            <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li><br>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li> <br>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li><br>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li><br>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>

                Excellent and Authentic recipe! A little more work and ingredients, but well worth it. 
                Use FRESH basil for more flavor, it cooks down and is sooo aromatic.<br> <br>The mix of sausage 
                and beef is sublime, so no need for more salt. I always add a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta 
                mixture (an old italian secret!). I usually make this a day ahead for the flavour and herbs 
                to meld in the fridge then let it sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before baking.<br> <br>Have 
                made for company too, and always get RAVES on it's authenticity. Great, winter confort  food and <br>
                feeds a lot a people. Another tip for lasagna makers - no need to wash another por to boil noodles <br>
                Soak raw, hard noodles in a large bowl of very hot tap water for 20-30 min. Noodles won't be cooked <br>
                but soft, and can complete it's cooking in the oven. I learned this from a caterer - try it!!!!
